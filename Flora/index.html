    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>We take pride in providing high quality, fresh-cut flowers and fast, reliable flower delivery for our customer. Beautiful, expertly designed arrangements are hand-delivered by one of our member florists located across the country. The local florist will create your beautiful arrangement at their flower shop and will personally hand-deliver it to your recipient in a vase.</p>
    <p>Our flowers are ready to be enjoyed immediately, unlike other online flower companies, we never pack warehouse flowers into a box to be shipped by truck across the country. Merryflora sends all of its orders to local florists. By supporting local businesses we strengthen entire communities.</p>
    <p>Everyone involved - from our florists, to our delivery drivers, to our customer advisors - all take care to add a little personal touch to the Merryflora experience.</p>
    <p>We're also proud that so many award-winning florists choose to be part of the Merryflora family. Each of our expert florists has the unique blend of skills, creativity and attention to detail needed to create every handmade Merryflora bouquet.</p>
